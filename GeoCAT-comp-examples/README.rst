GeoCAT-comp Examples
====================

This gallery contains usage examples for the GeoCAT-comp functions.
These examples are represented as Python scripts and their
corresponding Jupyter notebooks, which may or may not contain
visualizations (i.e. Matplotlib plots), depending on the function
characteristics.

For visualization, mainly `matplotlib` and `cartopy` are used. In addition,
`geocat-datafiles <https://github.com/NCAR/geocat-datafiles>`_ is used as a
dataset storage and `geocat-viz <https://github.com/NCAR/geocat-viz>`_ is used for
a higher level implementation for low level `matplotlib` functionalitie., `Xarray` and `numpy` are used for data processing.
