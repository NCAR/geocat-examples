This gallery contains visualization examples from many plotting categories
of geosciences data.

For visualization, mainly `matplotlib` and `cartopy` are used. In addition,
`geocat-datafiles <https://github.com/NCAR/geocat-datafiles>`_ is used as a
dataset storage, `geocat-viz <https://github.com/NCAR/geocat-viz>`_ is used for
a higher level implementation for low level `matplotlib` functionalities, as
well as `xarray` and `numpy` are used for data processing.
