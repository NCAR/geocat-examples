.. Warning::
    This version of the gallery uses experimental features from
    `geocat-viz <https://github.com/NCAR/geocat-viz>`_. We advise against
    using this version of the gallery to learn how to make visualizations,
    as it will be minimally maintained for plotting accuracy. However, we
    still want to provide it as a sneak peak for the GeoCAT user community.
    To see the latest stable version of the gallery, click on the version
    at the bottom of the contents panel on the left and select ``latest``.

This gallery contains visualization examples from many plotting categories
of geosciences data.

For visualization, mainly `matplotlib` and `cartopy` are used. In addition,
`geocat-datafiles <https://github.com/NCAR/geocat-datafiles>`_ is used as a
dataset storage and `geocat-viz <https://github.com/NCAR/geocat-viz>`_ is used for
a higher level implementation for low level `matplotlib` functionalities.
`Xarray` and `numpy` are used for data processing.
