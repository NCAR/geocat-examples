GeoCAT-examples Documentation
=============================

This gallery contains visualization examples from many plotting categories
of geosciences data (under the
`Gallery <https://geocat-examples.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gallery/index.html>`_
tab) and usage examples for the functions of the GeoCAT computational component,
`GeoCAT-comp <https://geocat-comp.readthedocs.io>`_ (under the
`GeoCAT-comp Examples
<https://geocat-examples.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gallery-geocat-comp/index.html>`_
tab).

For visualization, mainly `matplotlib` and `cartopy` are used. In addition,
`geocat-datafiles <https://github.com/NCAR/geocat-datafiles>`_ is used as a
dataset storage and `geocat-viz <https://github.com/NCAR/geocat-viz>`_ is used for
a higher level implementation for low level `matplotlib` functionalities.
`Xarray` and `numpy` are used for data processing.
