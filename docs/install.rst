Installation
============

This installation guide includes only the GeoCAT-examples installation instructions.
Please refer to `GeoCAT Contributor's Guide <https://geocat.ucar.edu/pages/contributing.html>`_
for installation of the whole GeoCAT project.

Installing GeoCAT-examples
--------------------------

GeoCAT-examples is a collection of standalone visualization examples, and it is not distributed
as a conda package; thus, there is no installation for it (via conda or other package management
systems). Because of this, this sections refers to building GeoCAT-examples, and it can be followed
better through the `Installation document on Github repository
<https://github.com/NCAR/GeoCAT-examples/blob/main/INSTALLATION.md>`_.
