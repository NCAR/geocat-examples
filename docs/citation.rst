How to cite GeoCAT-examples
---------------------------

If you use this software, please cite it as described below.

GeoCAT-examples is a collection of standalone visualization examples, and it is not distributed
as a versioned software tool (see
`here <https://geocat-examples.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html>`__ for further details);
however, we still generate GitHub tags/releases for it to distinguish between newly added functions
and the older ones. Each GeoCAT-examples Github release is assigned a separate Digital Object
Identifier (DOI) to allow users to access older releases. This ensures that users are not only able
to cite the specific GitHub release through DOIs but are also able to download & use the
corresponding release for reproducibility purposes.

If you would like to cite GeoCAT-examples as a whole (without referring to a specific GitHub release),
use the following text:

**Visualization & Analysis Systems Technologies. (2020).
Geoscience Community Analysis Toolkit: GeoCAT-examples [Software].
Boulder, CO: NSF NCAR Computational and Information Systems Lab. doi:10.5281/zenodo.6678258.**

Instead, if you would like to cite a specific GitHub release of GeoCAT-examples, use the following text:

**Visualization & Analysis Systems Technologies. (\<Year\>).
Geoscience Community Analysis Toolkit: GeoCAT-examples (v\<version\>) [Software].
Boulder, CO, USA: NSF NCAR Computational and Information Systems Lab. doi:\<DOI\>.**

In the above citation text, update the year, GeoCAT-examples version, and DOI as appropriate. For
example:

**Visualization & Analysis Systems Technologies. (2022).
Geoscience Community Analysis Toolkit: GeoCAT-examples (v2022.05.0) [Software].
Boulder, CO, USA: NSF NCAR Computational and Information Systems Lab. doi:10.5281/zenodo.6678263.**

Please find DOIs for all the GeoCAT-examples GitHub releases `here
<https://zenodo.org/record/6678263>`__.

Please note: The DOI minting service, Zenodo, might be suggesting their own citation text (as
they are the publisher of such DOIs) in their website. We prefer the text we recommend here to be used;
however, either way is acceptable.
