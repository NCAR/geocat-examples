Notebook Gallery
================

This gallery contains visualization examples that are solely implemented in the
Jupyter notebook format (i.e. no .py script). These notebooks are pre-executed, i.e.
they are being shown within GeoCAT-examples without need for execution.

If the reader would like to execute these notebooks in their local setup, they
will need to have a conda environment that includes a Jupyter technology of
preference (e.g. Jupyter Lab, etc.). For further details about how to create
such an environment, please look at the
`Installation <https://geocat-examples.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html>`_
page.

In addition to the above environment, each notebook
example lists its own dependencies that should be installed as well.
