Notebook Gallery
================

This gallery contains visualization examples that are solely implemented in the
Jupyter notebook format (i.e. no `.py` script). Most, if not all, of these
notebooks are interactive  (i.e. the rendered images can be panned, zoomed,
etc). However, these notebooks are currently pre-rendered only, i.e. the
gallery only shows static renderings of the notebooks (Notebooks won't actually
show any greater resolution when the user zooms a plot; the user can zoom in all
they like, but the data is never re-rendered). To fully experience
the power of interactive exploration within a notebook, it will need to be
downloaded and executed locally as described below.

If the reader would like to execute these notebooks in their local setup, they
will need to have a conda environment that includes a Jupyter technology of
preference (e.g. Jupyter Lab, etc.). For further details about how to create
such an environment, please look at the
`Installation <https://geocat-examples.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html>`_
page.

In addition to the above environment, each notebook
example lists its own dependencies that should be installed as well.
