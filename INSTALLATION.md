# How to install GeoCAT-examples

GeoCAT-examples is a collection of standalone visualization examples, and it is not distributed as a conda package;
thus, there is no installation for it (via conda or other package management systems). Because of this, this section
refers to accessing the GeoCAT-examples scripts and how to build a conda environment to run them in. These instructions
can be followed better through the [installation page](https://geocat-examples.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html)
on the GeoCAT-examples gallery website.
