# How to install GeoCAT-examples
> **Warning**
>    This version of the gallery uses experimental features from [geocat-viz](https://github.com/NCAR/geocat-viz>). We advise against using this version of the gallery to learn how to make visualizations, as it will be minimally maintained for plotting accuracy. However, we still want to provide it as a sneak peak for the GeoCAT user community. To see the latest stable version of the gallery, switch to the `main` branch.

GeoCAT-examples is a collection of standalone visualization examples, and it is not distributed as a conda package;
thus, there is no installation for it (via conda or other package management systems). Because of this, this section
refers to accessing the GeoCAT-examples scripts and how to build a conda environment to run them in. These instructions
can be followed better through the [installation webpage](https://geocat-examples.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html)
on the GeoCAT-examples gallery website.
